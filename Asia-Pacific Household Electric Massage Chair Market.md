Offline sales involve traditional brick-and-mortar retail outlets, such as electronics stores, home appliance shops, and wellness centers.

Additionally, offline sales cater to consumers who seek immediate delivery and installation, which is a key advantage over online shopping. Many retailers also offer exclusive in-store promotions or discounts, which further attract customers to physical locations. Despite the rise of online shopping, offline sales continue to play a pivotal role in the distribution of electric massage chairs in the Asia–Pacific region, especially in more traditional markets.On the other hand, the online sales segment is growing at an unprecedented rate, driven by the increasing penetration of e-commerce platforms across Asia–Pacific. E-commerce giants such as Amazon, Alibaba, and local online retailers have made it easier for consumers to explore a wide range of electric massage chairs from various brands, compare prices, and read reviews before making a purchase. The convenience of shopping from home, along with the availability of detailed product information and customer feedback, has contributed to the rapid adoption of online shopping for household massage chairs.
